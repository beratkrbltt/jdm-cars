#  **JDM Cars Showcase** 

**Responsive JDM Cars Showcase Website – A Personal Coding Project** ✨

---

## 🚀 **Overview**
I created this JDM Cars showcase website as a fun and educational project. Being a fan of Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) cars, I wanted to design a site that highlights their culture and iconic models.

The project features a clean and responsive design using HTML5 and CSS3, incorporating Flexbox, CSS Grid, and modern layout techniques to create visually engaging sections. The website is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
